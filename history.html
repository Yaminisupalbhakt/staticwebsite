        <p class="p-1 text-justify">The word ‘computer’ has a very interesting origin. It was first used in the 16th century for a person who
          used to compute, i.e. do calculations. The word was used in the same sense as a noun until the 20th century.
          Women were hired as human computers to carry out all forms of calculations and computations.

          By the last part of the 19th century, the word was also used to describe machines that did calculations. The
          modern-day use of the word is generally to describe programmable digital devices that run on electricity.
